# I recommend you copy this file to your group_vars/all folder
#
# GenerateFirmwareVars will create this file or (if specified) will take a current firmware.yml and merge into a new one.

# 13G_Monolithic:
#   iDRAC8:
#     - PowerEdge_R730xd
#     - PowerEdge_R630
#
# 12G_Monolithic:

#     - PowerEdge_R720xd
#     - PowerEdge_R720
#
# options:
#   element_name:
#     - optional
#     - ElementName from EnumerateSoftwareIdentity. Created when this file is generated with GenerateFirmwareVars so that you'll have something to use when getting the url from Dell's website.
#   url:
#     - required
#     - Usually the URL to download from Dell. Can be used to download locally or if share_uri not specified will be passed to the iDRAC.
#   share_uri:
#     - optional
#     - if specified this will be passed to the iDRAC. Can be http, ftp, tftp, cifs, or nfs. If not specified the url will be used.
#   target_version:
#     - required
#     - The version of software to be installed. Used to check the installed version doesn't match the one to be installed before trying the install.
#   minimum_version:
#     - optional
#     - If you run into a situation where an install won't complete you may need to install a firmware version between the one installed and the one you are trying to install.
#   component_id:
#     - optional
#     - If specified this will be used to match the 'ComponentID' from EnumerateSoftwareIdentity.
#   indentity_info_value:
#     - optional
#     - If specified this will be used to match the 'IdentityInfoValue' from EnumerateSoftwareIdentity.
#   search:
#     - optional
#     - Uses a regular expression search of the 'ElementName' from EnumerateSoftwareIdentity to find a match. This is a last resort and I recommend you use either the component_id or indentity_info_value.
#
#  Matching order:
#    1. key. idrac, bios, diagnostics, os_collector, and driver_pack should only match one.
#    2. component_id. if specified. Best used for disks, power supplies, RAID backplane, RAID enclosure
#    3. indentity_info_value. if specified. Best used for NICs, RAID controller
#    4. search. if specified. Searches the 'ElementName' from EnumerateSoftwareIdentity. Last resort.
